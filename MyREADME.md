## Description
This project is called readme generator, and my motivation for creating this project is to create a simple time creating an readme file. I created this project because I wanted to make it easier to create a readme file. I believe the problem this project is solving is that it makes it more convenient to come up withe a readme file. I learned many things from creating this project such as how to use inquirer and node. There are many similar projects like this one, but what makes my rendition of it stand out is that the attention to detail I put in that no one else would. I believe this project is solving problems such as that it makes it more convenient to come up withe a readme file.
