## Description
This project is called README.md Generator, and my motivation for creating this project is TO make it much more convenient and easy to create a README.me file. I created this project because Sometimes it can be a hassle to create a README.md file from scratch, especially when you have just completed a long project,  I believe that this will make it much more  pain-free to  create a readme file. I believe the problem this project is solving is making it much more convenient to create a README.md file. I learned many things from creating this project such as I learned much more about node as well as inquirer. There are many similar projects like this one, but what makes my rendition of it stand out is that The attention to detail that I incorporated, as well as the options I provided. I believe this project is solving problems such as making it much more convenient to create a README.md file.
