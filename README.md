## Description
This project is called README.md Generator, and my motivation for creating this project is To make it simple to create a README.md file. I created this project because to make it much more convinient to create a readme file. I believe the problem this project is solving is conveience in createing a readme file. I learned many things from creating this project such as inquirer and node. There are many similar projects like this one, but what makes my rendition of it stand out is that attention to detail and ease of use. I believe this project is solving problems such as conveience in createing a readme file.
